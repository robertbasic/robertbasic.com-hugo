I've been using [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) a lot more recently, but not enough to have all the commands in muscle memory. Writing down a quick cheat-sheet for working with split panes/windows.

To split a screen pane horizontally: `Ctrl+a Shift+s`.

To split a screen pane vertically: `Ctrl+a Shift+\`.

To move between panes: `Ctrl+a Ctrl+Tab`.

To start a new command line in a pane: `Ctrl+a Ctrl+c`.

To close the focused pane: `Ctrl+a Shift+x`.

Happy hackin'!
