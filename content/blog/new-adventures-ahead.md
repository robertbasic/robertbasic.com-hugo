After a month or two of pondering and thinking and planning and thinking and some more thinking, today I finally told the management at <a href="http://solutions.online.rs/">work</a> that I'll be leaving in a month from today. Actually, I won't be extending my contract with them which will end on June 24th.

Why? I don't like the road the leadership of the company has taken (if this can be called a road at all...), the amount of energy the whole team is wasting on some small and silly things, the fact that extra effort is not recognised, thanked or paid and that there's currently 8 of us in a roughly 25 m^2 room.

I know, there are bad moments everywhere when one just have to suck it up and deal with it for the whole team/company, but I've been doing that for quite some time and I had enough of that.

The only thing that makes me sad about this decision is that I'll be leaving <a href="http://twitter.com/milosija">@milosija</a> on his own here, a great mentor and friend from whom I've learnt a lot.

On the other hand, as of June 25th I'll be starting my own company, which should be an exciting new experience. Still need to wrap my head around that one, so more on that in some future post...

Until then,<br />
happy hackin'!
