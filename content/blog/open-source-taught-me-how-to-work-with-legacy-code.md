Contributing to open source projects has many benefits &mdash; you learn and you teach, you can make friends or find business partners, you might get a chance to travel. Even have a [keynote](https://joind.in/event/phpbenelux-conference-2017/using-open-source-for-fun-and-profit) at a conference, like [Gary](https://twitter.com/GeeH) did.

Contributing to open source projects was the best decision I made in my professional career. Just because I contributed to, and blogged about [Zend Framework](/tags/zf), I ended up working and consulting for a company for four and a half years. [I learned a lot](/blog/things-i-learned-in-the-past-four-years/) during that time.

What I realized just recently is that open source also taught me how to work with legacy code. It taught me how to find my way around an unknown codebase faster, where to look and what to look for when investigating an issue. Most importantly, it taught me how to <strong>react</strong> to legacy code.

Usually when people hear "legacy code", they think code that was written by a bunch of code monkeys who know nothing about writing good software. The past was stupid, the present is smart and wise, and will make everything better for the future. A long time ago, I was the same.

Today, my thinking and my approach is completely different.

I have the utmost respect for the programmer and their code that is before me. Rarely do I have the privilege knowing the circumstances under which a piece of legacy code was written.

In many cases the original author of the code is not on the team any more, or they just don't remember why was some decision made and a piece of code written in a certain way. It might be a <del>hack</del> workaround for a code that was written by someone even before their time on the project. Maybe they didn't know better at the time, or maybe they indeed made an error and now it's my bug to fix.

Whatever the reason is, the code is written, used, and it delivers business value. It requires maintenance, fixes, and improvements and I welcome the challenges it brings.

Happy hackin'!
