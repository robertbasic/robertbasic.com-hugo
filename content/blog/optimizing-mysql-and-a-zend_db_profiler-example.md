Last night I came across on a post on <a href="http://www.techfounder.net/" target="_blank">TechFounder</a>, about <a href="http://www.techfounder.net/2008/10/12/profiling-queries-with-zend_db-and-optimizing-them-by-hand/">using Zend_Db_Profiler</a> and a good example with real data on optimizing MySQL queries. For &#147;geeks&#148; who SQL speak fluently this will probably be no new stuff, but for great number of web developers (me included!) this will probably come in handy.

Cheers!
