<p>This week on Wednesday, finally one of my pet projects has hit the Internets! <a href="http://phpplaneta.net/">PHPPlaneta.net</a> is alive!</p>
<p>It's idea is to be a community website for PHP programmers from Serbia and other countries from the region. The idea for this website "hit" me somewhere in April or May I think, while I was lurking the interwebs for some, any PHP communities in the region, user groups, anything really, where local PHP programmers could share ideas, news, interests, etc., but found nothing (well, besides 2 bulletin boards and a few of us on Twitter). So, I decided to try and create one.</p>
<p>Of course, this website is only the first step. The purpose of this website is to share news, articles and whatnot with other programmers, something like Mr. Cornutt does on <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org/">phpdeveloper.org</a> ;) There's not much up there yet, but that'll change soon :) Altho the functionality of the website is pretty simple and I could've put it out in like 2 hours with wordpress, I wrote it from scratch (using Zend Framework of course!), just, well, because I can :D Once I tidy up the code and maybe refactor here and there, it'll be up on github (multiple reasons for putting it up there, but that's for some other post).</p>
<p>I have other ideas for the future, both online and offline related, but first want to put this website on it's feet.</p>
<p>So, here's to a better and brighter future for PHP communities around here!</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>
