I'll be giving a talk at this year's Hungarian Web Conference, <a href="http://webkonf.org/">Webkonf</a>, which will be held on October 8th in Budapest. The topic of the talk is Zend Framework 2 and with the recent happenings in the framework world and in the community (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/padraicb">Paddy</a>!), it will be both interesting and challenging to create a talk worth listening :) Oh, and I'll be presenting in Hungarian :)

If you'll be there, I'd like to meet you :) I'll be in Budapest from Friday the 7th, till Sunday the 9th.
