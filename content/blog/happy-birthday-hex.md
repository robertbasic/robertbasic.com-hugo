<p>I can't really believe this - but my little company <a href="http://hex.rs/">Hex</a>  is one year old! I know it sounds clichÃ©<span rel="pastemarkerend" id="pastemarkerend34809">, but it really feels like it was last week </span><a href="http://robertbasic.com/blog/announcing-hex">when I started this... adventure</a><span rel="pastemarkerend" id="pastemarkerend34809">. It's been one crazy year, that's for sure.<br>

</span></p>

<p><span rel="pastemarkerend" id="pastemarkerend34809">Worked on some interesting and some very interesting projects. Learned a lot, but there's still things to learn and skills to improve.<br>

</span></p>

<p>It was a fun ride so far and will continue to work hard as I really do enjoy all of this - with all of it's ups and downs.</p>

<p>Special thanks goes to <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/vranac">Vranac</a>, for his hard work, friendship and mentorship - may we continue to create awesome stuff in the years to come!</p>

<p>Happy hackin'!<br>
