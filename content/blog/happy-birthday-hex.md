I can't really believe this - but my little company <a href="http://hex.rs/">Hex</a>  is one year old! I know it sounds cliche, but it really feels like it was last week </span><a href="http://robertbasic.com/blog/announcing-hex">when I started this... adventure</a>. It's been one crazy year, that's for sure.

Worked on some interesting and some very interesting projects. Learned a lot, but there's still things to learn and skills to improve.

It was a fun ride so far and will continue to work hard as I really do enjoy all of this - with all of it's ups and downs.

Special thanks goes to <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/vranac">Vranac</a>, for his hard work, friendship and mentorship - may we continue to create awesome stuff in the years to come!

Happy hackin'!
