<a href="http://dorscluc.org/">DORS/CLUC</a> is a conference about GNU/Linux and everything open source which takes place in Zagreb, Croatia, on May 16-18. I sent two talk proposals and both got accepted! Yey! The first talk will about <a href="http://phpplaneta.net/">PHPPlaneta.net</a>, the story behind it, the ideas, the plans... The second talk will be an introduction to <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a>. I know, zf2 is right behind the corner with all it's PHP5.3 goodness, but we are still, and unfortunately will be for a while, stuck with hosting providers running php5.2.

Hopefully I'm not going to be the only PHP dev there and someone will find the talk(s) worth their time :D

More than anything I'm looking forward to finally visiting Croatia and meeting fellow hackers :)
