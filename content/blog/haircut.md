So, I got a haircut after 8 years.

This is the result. If you want, have a look at the whole album here: <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/111093783412798768777/ThereIFixDIt?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCLTU7rDW0qqJrwE&feat=directlink">There, I fix'd it</a>

I think it turned out pretty damn good.
