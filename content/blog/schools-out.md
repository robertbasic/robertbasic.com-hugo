<p>Today is one big day for me: I passed my last 2 exams at the College. 3 months of learning, a bit of luck and a professor in a good mood &#151; the winning combination! This is a big relief for me, cause I now can fully concentrate on programming, no other stuff to think of, just me and the code.</p>
<p>At the College I have only one more obligation, the graduate work. I've chosen to write a desktop application in Python; my mentor loved the idea, and this will be a great chance for me to learn something new. Need to work out the details with the mentor, but roughly I have it all in my head and on papers :)</p>
<p>I'm off to get my power-nap now, I'm dead tired and there's some code need to be written tonight :)</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
