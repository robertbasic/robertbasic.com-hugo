<p><a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.moblin.org/" title="Moblin" rel="homepage">Moblin</a> got me curios and I wanted to test it out:</p>
<blockquote><p>Moblin is an <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Open_Source" title="Open Source" rel="wikinvest">open source</a> project focused on building a Linux-based platform optimized for the next generation of mobile devices including Netbooks, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_internet_device" title="Mobile internet device" rel="wikipedia">Mobile Internet Devices</a>, and In-vehicle infotainment systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cause I don't own (yet!) a netbook, I installed it under <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" title="VirtualBox" rel="homepage">VirtualBox</a> (VB from now on). The image is 666 MB big and it comes not in an .iso, but in a .img format. But, VB, a really awesome software, had no troubles booting from it. As with the majority of Linux distros nowadays, Moblin image is also a <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD" title="Live CD" rel="wikipedia">Live CD</a>, which means you can run it, without installing it.</p>
<div id="attachment_729" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 300"><a href="http://robertbasic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/step10.png"><img src="http://robertbasic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/step10-300x247.png" alt="Installing Moblin" title="Installing Moblin" class="size-medium wp-image-729" height="247" width="300"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Installing Moblin</p></div>
<p>The preinstall process is made up from 6-7 steps: choosing the language, the keyboard layout, the timezone and, of course, the partitioning. Basically, it's just another boring â€œNext-Nextâ€ process. The installation itself took around 6 minutes to finish. When it's done, it asks for a username and a password.</p>
<p>The first boot went pretty quickly, considering that booting under VB takes longer than booting under regular installations. The thing about VB is that it needs, the so called â€œGuest Additionsâ€ installed on the guest machine, so that the guest machine can be used normally. In this case, I failed to install it: Moblin comes with one version of the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.kernel.org/" title="Linux kernel" rel="homepage">Linux kernel</a> and the additions are for another version of the kernel. This prevented me in my quest to test Moblin fully. Anyway, I've managed to take a few screenshots of it, all are uploaded to <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/robertbasic.com/Moblin">my Picasa profile</a>.</p>

<p>There was one thing that was strange. It has a â€œ<a href="http://moblin.org/documentation/moblin-netbook-intro/how-get-around-moblin-netbook-ui/status-panel">Status panel</a>â€, from which you can update your profiles on social networks. A really useful stuff. I just opened it up and updated <a href="http://twitter.com/robertbasic">my Twitter profile</a>. Almost. I wasn't logged in to Twitter from it and Moblin didn't say a word about it. It just happily said that my status is updated. Once I found the â€œ<a href="http://moblin.org/documentation/moblin-netbook-intro/show-me-how-connect-stuff/setting-web-services">Web services</a>â€ panel I logged in and this time I was really updating my Twitter stream.</p>
<p>I really was hoping to test it normally and write a detailed review of it, but this guest additions thingy thought otherwise. Moblin is a great <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution" title="Linux distribution" rel="wikipedia">distro</a>, even in this beta stage I believe it's useful. What do you think? Did you test it already, saw it in action?</p>
<p>One thing's for sure: when I'll get myself a netbook, it'll run on Moblin.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
