In early February I got an email from <a href="https://twitter.com/omerida">Oscar</a> would I be willing to write an article for <a href="https://www.phparch.com/">php[architect]</a>, based on my <a href="/talks/#easier-mocking-with-mockery">&ldquo;Easier mocking with Mockery&rdquo;</a> talk. It took me maybe 2 seconds to think about it and say &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;. The first part of the article was published in the <a href="https://www.phparch.com/magazine/2018-2/april/">April&rsquo;s edition</a> of the magazine. Lots of useful content in there, not just my article!

Initially I was supposed to write a 3000 word article on the subject, but in the end I wrote somewhere around 8000 words. Oops. Oscar was kind enough to let me keep the entire thing, so it was split into a two part article. I really enjoyed writing it and working with the fine folks from php[arch] on was great. I hope I get to write more for them.

If you have an idea for a PHP related article, I wholeheartedly recommend <a href="https://www.phparch.com/editorial/write-for-us/">reaching out to them</a>. It is really a great feeling to be a published author, even if it&rsquo;s &ldquo;just&rdquo; 3000 words.

Happy hackin'!
