    Most of my knowledge of the English language is self-taught. I had English classes in elementary school, but that was more or less singing "London bridge is falling down" and reciting a list of irregular verbs. I also had a semester of English in college, but that again consisted of reciting a list of irregular verbs (true, this time the list was longer) and reading and translating engineering texts. Good for learning how to read a technical manual, but not so much when it comes to having a conversation with other people. Other than that, it's all from computers, music, films, books.

    My mom has an old dictionary that I used to read when I was a kid. I remember spending hours upon hours flipping through the pages, learning words, trying to figure out how to pronounce them. Guess I was a nerd already when I was only seven years old.

    In the past few months <a href="https://twitter.com/Swizec">Swizec</a> was quite persistent with his nagging of how terrible my English is, especially when it comes down to the grammar, so I decided to do something about it.

    I started taking private English classes.

    I had my first hour and a half long lesson yesterday evening. I enjoyed it very much, had a lot of fun and already learned a thing or two (at least I think I did). I am taking the classes from an English teacher who also happens to be my friend. But, don't let the friendship fool you! She's not afraid off bashing me when I make a mistake: "Hold on Robert! That sentence doesn't make any sense!" (or something along those lines). And I think it is actually a good thing that we know each other from before as it is much easier to just start a random discussion and not just go through the textbook examples. All in all, very enjoyable classes and I know I will learn a lot from them.

    And to show that I am really serious about this, I started another blog dedicated to writing called <a href="http://magicofwriting.tumblr.com/">Magic of Writing</a>. And yes, I am aware that that sounds something like a five year old would come up with, but then again writing <em>is</em> magical. There's not much there yet, but I already have a few ideas in my head that will hopefully find their way onto paper.
