Last year (feels weird to say "last year", when it was less than a month ago) [Matthew](https://twitter.com/settermjd) asked me if I'd be willing to appear as a guest on his [Free the Geek podcast](http://freethegeek.fm/). To have a short chat about running my own software consultancy, freelancing, public speaking, and whatever else pops up.

Matthew is a great host, I have no idea why I was so nervous while chatting. Maybe because he also interviewed people like [Matthew](http://freethegeek.fm/episode/episode-0029), and [Matthew](http://freethegeek.fm/episode/episode-0018), and [Chris](http://freethegeek.fm/episode/episode-0017), and [Chris](http://freethegeek.fm/episode/episode-0016), all programmers that I learned and keep learning a lot from?

*\*wipes sweat off brow\**

In the end I'm really happy that I did this, if nothing else, because now I'm even more determined to improve my public speaking skills, to talk more at local meetups, to submit to more conferences.

Anyway, have a [listen to our chat](http://freethegeek.fm/episode/episode-0030), and make sure to subscribe to [the podcast](http://freethegeek.fm/), I'm sure Matthew will have more great guests we can all learn from in the future.

Happy hackin'!
