2012 was a real fine year, filled with travel, friends, work, longboards, books. A couple of beers found their way in my belly, too. The best part is that I honestly can't remember that a single bad thing happened this year. Most likely because it didn't. Pure awesomeness.

Can't really remember what I did from <b>January till March</b>, besides working. Odd. I should probably blog more often (HA!) on the things that happen. Oh well.

<b>April</b> was the month that kicked off the travels for this year. I spent a weekend in Budapest, doing nothing just roaming around the city. I stayed in a 5 star hotel in downtown. Never stayed in a fancy place like that before, and I wanted to try it out. Definitely not my thing, and did get the strange looks from the employees there as I stubmled in in a leather jacket and a military backpack on my back. I probably looked like a hobo. But I had fun and that's what counts.

<b>May</b> was the month of <a href="http://2012.phpday.it/">PHPDay</a> and travelling to Verona with Vranac. I just realised I didn't blog about it. Well, fuck. We met there some crazy awesome developer dudes from Croatia *waves hi to <a href="https://twitter.com/allixsenos">Luka</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/msvrtan">Miro</a>  and <a href="https://twitter.com/ihabunek">Ivan</a> *. Got to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/juokaz">Jouzas</a>  and <a href="https://twitter.com/skoop">Stefan</a>, and be mentored by <a href="https://twitter.com/patrick_allaert">Patrick</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/derickr">Derick</a>  and <a href="https://twitter.com/rasmus">Rasmus</a>  on creating PHP extensions. I even got to get a "You are correct" from Rasmus for a sentence I managed to mutter out. I was giggling like a girl for days after that.

On our way back to Novi Sad, we stopped in Ljubljana to grab lunch with <a href="https://twitter.com/Ponywithhiccups">Masa</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Swizec">Swizec</a>. First time meeting them in person, lovely people.

<b>June</b> was a month of work and <a href="http://robertbasic.com/blog/happy-birthday-hex">celebrating one year of Hex!</a>

<b>July</b> was the month of Exit festival in Novi Sad, where I played a host for Swizec, hopefully a good one, as he was staying over at my place. Couple days after the festival, we popped in his car, bought some gas, and of we were to Ljubljana. <a href="http://robertbasic.com/blog/ljubljana-slovenia">I stayed there</a> for a couple of days, completely touristy visit, with me roaming around this gorgeous town with a proper paper map in my hands. Bought my first longboard there and found myself in love with a non-geek hobby for the first time in my life. I'd never thought I'll say this, but sports are fun! Longboarding, at least.

<b>August</b> was spent with me longboarding around Novi Sad. Work and beers were also characteristic for that month.

<b>September</b> started with me going to a mountainboarding event, as a spectator only. I ended up going down <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=340572299367167&amp;l=319339718b">this hill</a>. And falling. Twice. I also made a total of over <a href="http://robertbasic.com/blog/one-hundred-kilometers">a hundred kilometers</a> longboarding.

In <b>October</b> Jouzas was in Novi Sad for a couple of days. Vranac and I did our best to make his stay enjoyable. Hope we succeeded at that. I ended up shaving my head, whilst having a severe hangover, and making a mohawk. Fun times!

<b>November</b> was the month of <a href="http://webcampzg.org/">Webcamp Zagreb</a>
  and us travelling to, obviously, Zagreb. And again, I didn't blog 
about it. Miro will kill me next time he sees me. The conference was a 
total success, very well done, even though it was planned and organized 
in under two months! Eagerly awaiting next year's event.

After Zagreb I hopped over to Ljubljana (by now you must have realised 
I'm sorta-kinda in love with that town), where I stayed for a week and 
worked from the local hackerspace Hekovnik. The rainy weather sucked a 
bit, and I was hoping I'd get to longboard more, but the one session on 
Trzin with Swizec was quite enjoyable. I even managed to do my first 
mini Coleman slide. Hooray!<br>

<b>December</b> was nothing special, just your regular, hard working (or hardly working?) month.<br>
<br>
A couple of things I'm not satisfied from the past year is that I didn't contribute to OSS much and didn't really learn new things. I also read lot less books than I thought I did - merely some ten-ish books. I'll just blame "A Dance With Dragons" for that as it took me two or three months to finish it.

As for 2013, there's no reason really for it to be any less awesomer than 2012. Need to fix and fine tune a couple of things about me, get rid of some bad habits, continue fixing some mistakes from the past and try to be even better to my fellow humans.

Happy New Year and Happy Hackin'!
