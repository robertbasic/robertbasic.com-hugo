Just a little heads up to all of you who stumble upon this place: I'll be moving servers and stuff in the coming month to linode and most likely there'll be some downtimes and fuckups so just thought to let you all know (this sounds like there's someone reading this blog at all, heh).

Hope I won't forget to make backups.
