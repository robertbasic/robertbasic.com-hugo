In 2009 some good stuff happened and some bad stuff happened. All in all, a crappy year. Hopefully, this year will be a lot better...

I graduated on June 26th, the topic was a Python desktop application that communicates with a web service; both sending and receiving data is possible. Started working on July 1st at <a href="http://theonlinesolutions.com/">Online Solutions</a> as a PHP dev and started to "officially" give back to the Open Source community by joining the <a href="http://robertbasic.com/blog/zend-framework-bug-hunt-days/">ZF Bug Hunt Days</a> - so far few minor patches submitted and applied. Wrote a <a href="http://robertbasic.com/blog/zend-framework-18-web-application-development-book-review/">review on a ZF book</a> and another one on jQuery and PHP is in the drafts.

I ain't making plans for this year, cause I have failed miserably to realize my most important plan for 2009; I'll just improvise throughout the year.

Dear 2009 - up yours. 2010 - bring it on.

Happy new year!
