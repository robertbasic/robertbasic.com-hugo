<p>Often times people ask me why do I contribute to open source, why do I "waste money and time" on free stuff when I could easily do the same thing for money? Don't have I enough of staring at the computer at work where, well, I do the same thing - hack on code? Ummm. No.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't earn much. Enough for the rent, bills, food, but giving the fact that I don't have a family, it's enough for me, for now. So, I don't make a s**t loads of money, but am still willing to work for free? Ummm. No.</p>
<p>Thing is, I really don't consider this to be work. This is fun. This is hacking. This is creating stuff. This is solving problems. <strong>This is my passion</strong>. So no, I don't work for free. I don't work. I code, I hack.</p>
<p>But why open source?</p>
<h3>Giving back</h3>
<p>Giving back is nice. Not necessarily giving back to the same project, but just giving back to the open source community in general. It just makes you a better and nicer person :)</p>
<h3>Knowledge</h3>
<p>Both in high school and in college the fastest way for me to gain knowledge was to learn, collaborate with other students. Open source gives me the chance to share knowledge with hackers from all over the world; from Portugal, via Nova Scotia to Texas. It gives me the chance to be taught and to teach.</p>
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>Open source gives the opportunity to work with people from every part of the globe. Getting ideas across by the means of email, chat, irc can be hard. Open source gives me the chance to improve my communication skills. Heck, I sometimes even have troubles explaining my ideas to my co-workers who sits right next to me.</p>
<p>Reading other peoples code, fixing bugs, writing documentation, adding new features, testing. Hack skills ++</p>
<p>Also, each and every accepted patch and merged pull request gives me that warm and fuzzy feeling inside.</p>
<h3>Contacts</h3>
<p>Open source introduces you to new people. Who knows what can come out of these random introductions? Can't be bad, that's for sure.</p>
<p>This is why I contribute to open source: it is fun, it is hacking, it is creating stuff, it is solving problems.</p>
<p>It is my passion.</p>
