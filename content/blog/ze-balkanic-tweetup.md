It all started with <a href="http://twitter.com/robertbasic/status/1979854514">this</a>. Just another bored tweet from yours truly after the Sunday lunch. Followed by tweets like <a href="http://twitter.com/VladGeorgescu/status/1979859296">this</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/anca_foster/status/1979880192">this</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/bojanpejic/status/1980037924">this</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/vranac/status/1980111818">this</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/nikolaplejic/status/1980164728">this</a>. I'll just blame the fact that it's Sunday afternoon for the low response and that we geeks <strong>do have a life!</strong> (well, most of us... some of us...)

<h2>What's the point?</h2>

To meet. To really get to know those people behind the avatars and tweets and funny names like "Swizec".

<h2>Who can come?</h2>

Despite the "Balkanic" part in the name, anyone can come, no matter from where you are. Be friendly and don't hate the geeks (geeks run the world, so, beware). One rule only: you have to have a <a href="http://twitter.com" title="Twitter" rel="homepage">Twitter</a> account. On the list below you'll read later are my friends from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania" title="Romania" rel="wikipedia">Romania</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary" title="Hungary" rel="wikipedia">Hungary</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia" title="Slovenia" rel="wikipedia">Slovenia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia" title="Croatia" rel="wikipedia">Croatia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina" rel="wikipedia">Bosnia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia" title="Serbia" rel="wikipedia">Serbia</a>. If you have a friend from these countries and I don't know her or him, do not worry, she or he, can come too. As long as they have a Twitter account.

<h2>When?</h2>

In autumn. September, most likely, during a weekend, when no sane person should be working. Our dear <a href="http://twitter.com/anca_foster">Anca</a> had a knee surgery recently and will have another one sometimes in July and <strong>we shall wait for her to fully heal and recover!</strong> (the hashtag is #wewaitforanca).

<strong>Update:</strong> I created <a href="http://twtpoll.com/tye3xy">a twtPoll on when to organize</a> the #balkanictweetup Please give your vote!

<h2>Where?</h2>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest" title="Budapest" rel="wikipedia">Budapest, Hungary</a>. Well, that's one suggestion. But it can be somewhere else. As long as we are together :-* It would be great to last at least one night (2 days that is), but I'm fine with more, too. One day is not possible. I expect lots of you guys there and it would be impossible to drink beers with all of you in one day only (oh yeah baby, we're gonna have lot's of beers). So, it would be great to find a cheap hotel where there are those fancy conference halls.

<h2>What will we do?</h2>

Chat (IRL!!!) and eat and drink and goof around and laugh and cry and sleep (NOT!) and take pictures and go do stuff and most importantly, we'll TWEET!!!1 There will be one special event that will be important for everyone to attend: we'll sit around in a big freakin' circle and introduce - stand up, say hi my name is Robert, aka @robertbasic and sit down (no need for the "and I'm a Twitter addict" part, we all know that).

We also can give talks on some silly topics. We can show off our works. We can sing odes to the Twitter Bird. We really can do what we want. The sky is the limit.

<h2>Other stuff of interest</h2>

The official hashtag is <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=+balkanictweetup">#balkanictweetup</a>.

The Tweetup tagline is "Bring netbooks and beers."

The official #balkanictweetup Twitter account is <a href="http://twitter.com/balkanictweetup">@BalkanicTweetup</a>.

<del datetime="2009-05-31T21:22:45+00:00">I spent all my money on beers and women so if a good Samaritan wants to support us with buying a domain and hosting for this event that would be, like, very nice of you. You would have your own page on the official #balkanictweetup page where we praise you and your good deeds.</del> The domain is bought by <a href="http://twitter.com/VladGeorgescu">Vlad Georgescu</a>. Thanks Vlad!

I am too lazy to make the list of my friends I promised earlier, so there will be no list for now. Sorry.

He, who likes this silly idea, drop me a love letter to zebalkanictweetup at gmail dot com with your real name (yes, Jozef, I mean, Swizec, you too!) and your Twitter username. I'll make a list based on that.

I gotta run now. Please, share your thoughts in the comments below.

Love,<br />
Robert :-*

P.S.: Due to insane amounts of spam, I'm moderating the comments, so please wait while I approve yours. Thanks :)
