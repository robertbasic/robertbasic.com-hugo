This past weekend the <a href="http://webkonf.org/">Hungarian web conference</a> was held in the amazing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buda_Castle">Buda Castle</a>, in Budapest. It was a one day conference, with talks being held on 3 tracks, all in all 21 talk. This was my first time here and I attended as a speaker with a talk on Zend Framework 2 (more on that later).

The conference was great, and, as per the organizers, attended by more than 700 people! The building is quite big, so I didn't feel like it was too crowded, but there were some complaints about not having enough seats for everyone. I found it weird that there was no proper lunch time set, with only 15-20 minutes left between sessions, so I ended up eating only after 3PM.

<a href="http://webkonf.org/2011/program.html">The talks</a> I attended were also great, especially the PHP 5.4 introduction talk by <a href="http://tyrael.hu/">KovÃ¡cs Ferenc</a>, aka <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Tyr43l">Tyr43l</a>, and the MySQL high availability and the InnoDB data recovery talks by Podor IstvÃ¡n.

As for my talk... Well, that was just plain horror. I got so nervous at the beginning that I completely forgot what was I supposed to say. A completely blank mind. Just standing there, looking at the slides and not knowing what am I even doing there... Completely fubar'd the first part of the presentation. The second part got somewhat better, but my overall feeling is just... Ugh, kill me now, please.

Anyway, I decided to give up on my speaking "career" and just stick to programming.

Happy hackin'!
