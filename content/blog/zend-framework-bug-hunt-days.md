On the 19th and 20th of this month, the third Zend Framework Bug Hunt days were held. I joined the party for the first time and I say, it was a jolly good one!

It was announced on <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/">Zend DevZone</a> after which <a href="http://twitter.com/padraicb">PÃ¡draic</a> wrote a nice and detailed <a href="http://blog.astrumfutura.com/archives/423-A-Guide-To-Zend-Framework-Bug-Hunt-Days.html">Guide To Zend Framework Bug Hunt Days</a> (I think I read on IRC that there'll be a <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Monthly+Bug+Hunt+Days">Bug Hunt Day FAQ</a>, too). I decided to try and give back to the community as much as I can. OK, it wasn't much - submitted a patch for an issue and closed another which was lacking information - but hey! I think it was pretty good for a noob bug hunter like me :P The only downside for me is it that it's held on Thursdays and Fridays, which means I can join up only after work. Blah.

All in all - <a href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=11199">more than 130 closed issues</a> - w00t!

So yep, see you all in December on the fourth Bug Hunt days ;)

Happy hacking!
