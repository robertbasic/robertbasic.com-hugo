<p> <a href="http://robertbasic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/zend-book-image.jpg"><img src="http://robertbasic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/zend-book-image.jpg" alt="zend-book-image" title="zend-book-image" width="100" height="123" class="alignright size-full wp-image-795" /></a> On Thursday (October 8th) I was contacted by mr. Priyanka Sanghvi from <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.packtpub.com" title="Packt Publishing" rel="homepage">Packt Publishing</a>. He made me an offer I couldn't refuse: to write a review on a new <a class="zem_slink" href="http://framework.zend.com/" title="Zend Framework" rel="homepage">Zend Framework</a> book! OMG! How cool is this? Very! :)</p>
<p>The book is titled <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/zend-framework-1-8-web-application-development/book">â€œZend Framework 1.8 Web Application Developmentâ€</a> and is written by <a href="http://www.thepopeisdead.com/">Keith Pope</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/muteor">@muteor</a> on Twitter):</p>
<blockquote><p>This book takes you through detailed examples as well as covering the foundations you will need to get the most out of the Zend Framework. From humble beginnings you will progress through the book and slowly build upon what you have learned previously. By the end, you should have a good understanding of the Zend Framework, its components, and the issues involved in implementing a Zend Framework based application.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'll publish my review here, soon as I get a copy of the book (it should arrive in a week or two), so stay tuned!</p>
<p>Until then, happy hacking!</p>
