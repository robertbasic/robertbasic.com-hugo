I just found a nice web site where you can &#147;smush&#148; your images &#151; <a href="http://smushit.com" target="_blank">Smushit.com</a>. SmushIt takes an image and removes all unnecessary information about it: when was it last edited, what image editor was used etc., but <b>keeps</b> the quality of the image! This is more than useful for sites where there are lots of images.

There are several ways to provide images to SmushIt:

<ul>
<li>Upload an image</li>
<li>Provide an URL to the image</li>
<li>Use the Firefox SmushIt add-on</li>
</ul>

The first two ways are quite obvious; provide an image and it'll process it in a few seconds.

The Firefox add-on is pretty cool: open up a web page where are the images you want to smush, click the SmushIt add-on icon (it'll be in the right corner of the status bar), it will take you to their site and process all the images found on your web page.

When the processing is complete, there will be a table showing details about the smushing. Also a download link will be provided, to download the smushed images in one zip file.

Now run little lurker and smush your images :)
