<p>I just found a nice web site where you can &#147;smush&#148; your images &#151; <a href="http://smushit.com" target="_blank">Smushit.com</a>. SmushIt takes an image and removes all unnecessary information about it: when was it last edited, what image editor was used etc., but <b>keeps</b> the quality of the image! This is more than useful for sites where there are lots of images.</p>
<div id="attachment_165" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 300"><a href="http://robertbasic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/smushit.gif"><img src="http://robertbasic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/smushit-300x159.gif" alt="The result of smushing" title="The result of smushing" width="300" height="159" class="size-medium wp-image-165" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The result of smushing</p></div>
<p>There are several ways to provide images to SmushIt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload an image</li>
<li>Provide an URL to the image</li>
<li>Use the Firefox SmushIt add-on</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two ways are quite obvious; provide an image and it'll process it in a few seconds.</p>
<p>The Firefox add-on is pretty cool: open up a web page where are the images you want to smush, click the SmushIt add-on icon (it'll be in the right corner of the status bar), it will take you to their site and process all the images found on your web page.</p>
<p>When the processing is complete, there will be a table showing details about the smushing. Also a download link will be provided, to download the smushed images in one zip file.</p>
<p>Now run little lurker and smush your images :)</p>
