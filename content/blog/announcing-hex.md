Well, guess it's time to announce it officially here, too. Since last month I'm running my own little web development company called <a href="http://hex.rs/">Hex</a>. After 2 years with the <a href="https://twitter.com/online_team">online_team</a>, it was time to move on and turn to new adventures.

The plan is simple and that's to continue to work on things I love: work with PHP and contribute to open source. The rest will be figured out along the way.

I've teamed up with my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/vranac">Vranac</a> and his company <a href="http://code4hire.com/">Code4Hire</a> to do what we're both good at - writing software. If you need some good programmers, don't hesitate to contact <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/vranac">Vranac</a> or <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/robertbasic">me</a>.

Happy hackin'!
