Also, bending any jQuery plugin to my will, was never a problem. But enough about me, you're here cause of the book.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/jquery-1-3-with-php/mid/251109ge2cro?utm_source=robertbasic.com&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_001614">jQuery 1.3 with PHP</a> is written by <a href="http://verens.com/">Kae Verens</a>, a JavaScript and PHP developer. This book is aimed at PHP developers who have met only a few times with JavaScript and jQuery, but I believe even a novice programmer can gain knowledge from it â€“ just be warned, the PHP examples are here for the sake of the examples only; about which the author warns throughout the book. As the author said: â€œThis book is designed to help a PHP developer write some immediately-useful client-side applications without needing weeks of studyâ€. And it will. </p>
<p>On the other hand, you need to know your HTML and CSS selectors, as the book only says that jQuery uses CSS selectors to select elements.</p>
<p>The examples in the book are well explained and commented!</p>
<p>The book starts off with an introductory chapter about jQuery, what it is, why the author chose it over other JS libraries, what projects use jQuery and so on...</p>
<p>The â€œQuick tricksâ€ chapter shows some really quick but useful tricks, such as dynamic select boxes, contextual help or inline editing. OK, you may have all done this before, but it's a good starting point for getting to know jQuery.</p>
<p>From chapter 3 to chapter 9, the author shows how to do things like validating forms, creating an event calendar, managing files and folders from the browser, rotating, cropping, resizing images (with <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imagemagick.org/" title="ImageMagick" rel="homepage">ImageMagick</a>!) also from the browser or making lists sortable by dragging and dropping items. Of course, no one wants to reinvent the wheel, so all the examples are using plugins â€“ either from the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> collection or â€œstandaloneâ€ plugins that are â€œtoo specificâ€ to be in the said collection.</p>
<p>My personal favorite chapter is the â€œData tablesâ€ chapter, which shows how to present and use table data on your website by adding sort, filter and pagination functionality to your table. The example shown uses a table with over 2 million rows, which is worth mentioning, cause this way we know that it'll work on a large dataset also.</p>
<p>The final chapter is reserved for optimizing the front-end code and reveals some stuff behind jQuery and JavaScript in general (I personally never knew that there's a speed difference between different type of selectors).</p>
<p>In conclusion, if you're a PHP dev wanting to â€œspice upâ€ your apps, this book will most likely worth the money spent.</p>
