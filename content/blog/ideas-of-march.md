<p>Apparently there's this new movement in the PHP community, <a href="http://www.phpdeveloper.org/news/16047">"Ideas of March"</a>, where we all pledge that we will blog more about PHP and web dev and the community in general. So here I am, doing the same :)</p>
<p>This will be a real test for me because for the 2 and a half years of this blog I've published merely 60 posts. Why? Mostly because I was (am?) scared to just write more about things I'm interested in. But, as I really do like blogging and letting my thoughts out I'll just have to do my best to write more :) and yes, it'll still mostly be PHP related with some linux or javascript stuff here and there :)</p>
<p>To see who pledged to blog more in March, check out <a href="http://www.phpdeveloper.org/news/16047">the list on PHPDeveloper</a> or follow the movement <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23ideasofmarch">on Twitter #ideasofmarch</a>.</p>
<p>Happy bloggin'!</p>
