It's been a while since I last wrote something; didn't have anything smart or interesting to say. Not that I do have this time. It's 4AM and I can't sleep. Can't really find the inspiration for work and writing (if you can consider these scribblings as writing). Lots of ssss... stuff happened which had a great impact on my mood and my ability to do something useful. And I just didn't felt like doing something about it. Until recently...

I was having a couple of beers with a friend of mine, with whom I go to college. After the 3rd beer or so, we came to an idea of submitting a paper to this year's <a href="http://bmf.hu/conferences/sisy2009/">SISY</a> conference. All I will say for now, that it will include <a href="http://www.python.org/" title="Python (programming language)" rel="homepage">Python</a>, Assembly, microcontrollers, electric motors and lots of other geeky stuff. This project, even while the idea is still only in my head, got my mind running again and might be the way out of this state of indifference. Why? Well, to be able to start this project, I first need to finish my current project, my graduate work. To finish my grad work, I needed to start working on it again (which I did, honest!). I'll even spend my whole Saturday this week in the college to write/test/debug my app there. If all goes well, the app will be finished this week and I can go onto writing the documentation for the grad work. Everything will go fine, right?

I installed <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" title="Ubuntu" rel="homepage">Ubuntu</a> 9.04 on my laptop a few days ago. Loving it! Had only 2 minor issues with the hardware upon the installation. First, the graphic card was messing around, it didn't want to enable all those funky visual effects. That got sorted out, thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/firusvg">@firusvg</a> who suggested to install compiz and <a href="http://twitter.com/ivan86">@ivan86</a> who pointed me to <a href="http://bud.bljak.org/?p=38">this article</a>. Second, when plugged in the headphones, the sound was still coming out on the speakers. <a href="http://twitter.com/Asgrim">@Asgrim</a> sent me <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/SonyVaioVGN-FW31J#Notes">this link</a> which helped me to sort this out. Apart from this, everything else works out-of-box. Even the wifi!

OK, enough for now. Here's to hoping that the bad times are over and the good times are coming. Cheers!
