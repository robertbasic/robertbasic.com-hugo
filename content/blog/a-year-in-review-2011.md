2011 has been and gone, all in all an excellent year for me; much better than the few clusterfuck years before. Going into 2012 with tons of positive energy and going to make it even better!

Sadly, not everything was perfect. In October my grandmother and one of my uncles passed away. Around the same time my Dad's shop was robbed, twice. That was a tough period for my parents and the entire family, still not over it completely, but not giving up either! We love and support each other and will get out stronger than ever.

Now that the bad part is out, let's jump to the awesome part ;)

<h3>Life changing decisions</h3>

In 2011 I actually had <strong>three</strong> life changing decisions.

First one in March, when I decided to finally quit smoking. And I did it! After 11 years I finally threw that shit away. Gave me a nice self-confidence boost, gained much needed weight - around 10kgs (now just to prevent that turning into fat and into muscles instead) - and I feel much, much better overall.

For the second one I owe a lot to my parents and to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/vranac">Srdjan Vranac</a>, for their continuos support and making it possible to happen. In May I handed over my resignation at my previous job and in June <a href="http://robertbasic.com/blog/announcing-hex/">I started my own company, Hex</a>, and joined up with <a href="http://code4hire.com/">Vranac</a>. Just this one thing changed my life to better in so many ways that I can't thank Vranac enough for all he did, and is still doing! Thank you :)

The third decision happened in August when <a href="http://robertbasic.com/blog/haircut/">I cut my hair</a>. And nope, I didn't regret it :)

<h3>Friends and conferences</h3>

This year I spoke at two conferences, <a href="http://robertbasic.com/blog/dorscluc-2011-recap/">DORS/CLUC</a> in May in Zagreb, and <a href="http://robertbasic.com/blog/webkonf-2011-recap/">Webkonf</a> in October in Budapest. My talks didn't turn out that good (heck, the second one was pure horror), but I did make new friends which trumps bad talks any day!

In Zagreb I had the honor to meet fellow hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nikolaplejic">Nikola Plejic</a>, who kindly offered me a place to stay during the conference and showed me around the city. Now waiting for him to come to Novi Sad so I can return the favor. :)

In Budapest I met fellow hackers <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Tyr43l">Ferenc Kovacs</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/djozsef">Dubravszky Jozsef</a>. Great people with whom I'd like to grab a beer or two this year :)

<h3>Open source and hacking</h3>

Contributed to <a href="http://web2project.net/">web2project</a> and <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a> throughout the year, but somewhere in September got really close to a burn out so I decided to back up a little and have a break. I'm trying to ease my way back in to contributing and general hacking now. Need to be careful though, don't want to get this close to a burn out again, next time might not see the line.

Started to learn C just for fun. Don't know what to do with it yet, can't hurt learning/knowing it.

All in all, awesome year which set the bar high for 2012, but with all this positive energy it will be a piece of cake to fly over it!

Happy hackin' and a happy new year!
