2018 was a good year. A year of changes.

My wife and I are expecting a baby in March 2019. We bought a house. We traveled. We drank some lovely tea. We read books. We ate great food in good company. We made new friends in a new city.

I changed jobs. I spoke at four conferences, one uncon, and two meetups. I wrote [a two part article on Mockery for phparch](https://robertbasic.com/blog/easier-mocking-with-mockery-in-phparchitect/). I gave a talk at the new job how to better use test doubles. I became a Dungeon Master for my Dungeons & Dragons group.

## Looking forward to 2019

I want to be home as much as possible with my wife and our kid, so I'll continue working from home. I'm gonna dial it back on the conferences, so my only plan for this year is to visit the [PHP Serbia conference](https://2019.phpsrbija.rs/) in May. But the learning can't stop, the plan is to redirect the conference budget to online courses and materials.

In 2019 I want to learn how not to create total shite User Experiences and User Interfaces on the web. Bought the [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/book/) material as a first step. Started learning what makes a modern web app in this day and age. I'll keep learning about Domain-Driven Design and do my best to implement what I've learned so far. Keep blogging about it all.

I want to pick up woodworking as a hobby. Together with the house we bought a bunch of tools from the previous owners, so now it's just the matter of going down to the garage and practicing. I also want to create a herb garden.

Here's to another amazing year.

Happy hackin'!
