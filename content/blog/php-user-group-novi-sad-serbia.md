For almost a year now, whenever time allows it, I'm working on a side project of creating a community of PHP programmers from around here. One of the first steps was, is, a website called <a href="http://phpplaneta.net/">PHPPlaneta</a> about which I wrote <a href="http://robertbasic.com/blog/a-regional-php-community-website/">back in October</a>. After bringing this website to a relatively steady position, time has come to take another step: creating a PHP User Group! I'm really good at naming things so it is called "<a href="http://phpug.phpplaneta.net/pugns/">PHP User Group Novi Sad</a>", or pugns for short.

Actually I really don't know what one has to do to create a user group, but I'll just improvise along the way. So far, the date, time and the place for the first meeting is set: April 5th, 6PM, in a local coffee shop by the Danube river. A website thingy is also up: <a href="http://phpug.phpplaneta.net/pugns/">pugns</a>, which is currently just a simple HTML page, but things will improve on that front too. The page of pugns is intentionally under a "directory", because I'd love to host information about other PHP user groups from around here on the <a href="http://phpug.phpplaneta.net">phpug.phpplaneta.net</a> (sub)domain. It'd be nice to keep all relevant information under one "roof".

Sooo... This will be an interesting ride, hope it'll turn out fine :)

Of course, if anyone has some advice, tips and tricks about organizing user groups please do share them, that would be highly appreciated :)
